# FaceTrainAndDetect

Training and detecting facial models base on Opencv

## Requirements

* WebCamera
* Windows 7 or later
* OpenCV 3.0(with opencv_contrib) or later
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015

In my repository, folder [ORLface]() contains facial samples of 40 people (each person has 10 picture samples).
You can train your own samples by placing the samples in the specified folder and editing the file at.txt.(This process is not reasonable and will be improved later)

## Progress

* 2017-07-01 The code can train the model successfully. Through the test, the models is available.

## Usage

* Click the *.sln file
* Configure the Opencv environment
* F5 Run !


## Install

Compiling Opencv_Contrib is more complex, see [opencv/opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib)
